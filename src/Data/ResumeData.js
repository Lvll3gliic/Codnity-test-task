export const background = [
  "I am originally from Cesis, a small town located in the Vidzeme region of Latvia. Growing up, I lived in the countryside near Cesis, where I developed a love for nature and outdoor activities. During my school years, I was an avid player of floorball and I played for the Cesis Lekrings team until I was 18 years old. Through my experience in team sports, I learned valuable skills such as teamwork, communication, and dedication. Currently, I live in Riga, the capital city of Latvia. While I enjoy the opportunities that the city offers, I often find myself returning to Cesis to participate in an amateur floorball league. I am currently studying IT and have gained a strong theoretical foundation in the field. While I have little work experience, I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world situations. I am a quick learner and thrive in environments where I can take on new challenges and expand my skill set. I believe that my background in team sports, coupled with my passion for technology and eagerness to learn, make me a strong candidate for a junior developer position. I am committed to bringing my best to any team I work with and am excited to contribute to the success of a dynamic and innovative company.",

export const philosophy = [
  "My personal philosophy centers around the idea of `go big or go home`. I am a firm believer in taking on challenges that may seem daunting or even impossible at first. In fact, I thrive on the sense of accomplishment that comes from pushing myself beyond my limits and achieving what I once thought was impossible. For me, `go big or go home` means that if I decide to take on a challenge, I commit myself to doing everything in my power to succeed. I believe in putting forth my best effort and not settling for mediocrity. If I am unable to give my all to a task, then I would rather not even start. I am always eager to learn new things and expand my knowledge, both personally and professionally. I see every challenge as an opportunity to learn and grow, and I approach each new experience with an open mind and a willingness to try new approaches. I also strongly believe in the power of habits and consistency. I know that true success and improvement come from dedication and persistence over time, rather than relying solely on natural talent or ability. With this in mind, I strive to maintain a daily routine that helps me build positive habits and stay focused on my goals. One of the ideologies that drives me is `one more day`. While I cannot promise that I will always succeed, I can promise that I will always give it my all, and that I will continue to strive towards my goals, one day at a time. I believe that this mindset is essential for achieving success, and I am committed to putting in the hard work and dedication required to become the best version of myself.",
